# GChamber  
**VR Gooning**

> https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1lYQJ14blNV4TafviUtmhpnVBpkb22W72

  - Immersive VR gooning experience.
  - You are surrounded by lewd images and videos.
  - The lewds constantly change and can come from either your own hard drive or be downloaded from (currently) four booru websites (e621, gelbooru, konachan, yandere).
  - Multiple scene options:
    - Standard goon chamber: A cylindric screen that wraps 360Â° around you with tons of pictures and videos, all of which play their sound for that nice brain melting experience (This will be customizable in the future, for now just turn volume to 0 if you find it annoying).
    - Theater view: A large video-only screen in the middle and some larger pictures next to it. This one's ideal for HMVs, as it plays every video from start to finish.

## Compatibility

<Compatibility windows />

## Usage

  1. Extract the zip file anywhere you'd like.
  2. Run GChamber.exe

In Settings you will be able to open the folder in which you can place your locally saved porn, as well as set up any boorus and image tags you'd like to use.

## Troubleshooting

Important: Gchamber is very resource hungry at the moment. Having at least 16 GB of RAM is recommended. Future versions will work better on potato PCs.

For oculus headsets, the 'B' button will toggle the menu. The rest should be pretty intuitive. 

(there's also a non-VR version in the Google Drive)
