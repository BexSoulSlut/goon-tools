# Virtual Succubus
**Sadistic hentai succubus tease**

  - A 3D succubus taunts and teases you through a jack off session.
  - Use tokens she awards you for good behaviour to pay for new outfits for her.
  - Make sure you do what she says, how you act in one session will affect future sessions!
  - Supports an insane number of settings, toys, genders, genitalia, and masturbation styles.

## Troubleshooting

### Linux Support
Your best bet to get the demo or patreon version working is to use either [Wine](https://www.winehq.org) or [Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton). Confirmed by Gray#6969 to work in Proton (on a steam deck).
