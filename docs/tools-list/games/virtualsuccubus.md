  - A 3D succubus taunts and teases you through a jack off session.
  - Use tokens she awards you for good behaviour to pay for new outfits for her.
  - Make sure you do what she says, how you act in one session will affect future sessions!
  - Supports an insane number of settings, toys, genders, genitalia, and masturbation styles.
  - Windows/Linux (with wine)

## Troubleshooting

### Linux Support
Your best bet to get the demo or patreon version working is to use either [https://www.winehq.org](wine) or [https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton](proton.) Confirmed by Gray#6969 to work in Proton (on a steam deck).
