# Dinohazard
**Seduce a buff dino guy or gal in VR or 2D**

> https://www.dinohazard.mutant-alley.com/

  - Chose outfits and gender of a massive dino
  - Seduce them in a back alleyway, don't be afraid to get handsy!
    - This isn't a visual novel! You can move around freely in the space, and use your hand and other appendages to mess around with the dino!
  - Fully voice-acted!
  - VR compatible, but plays in 2D as well.
